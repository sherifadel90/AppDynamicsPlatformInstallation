# AppDynamics Platform Installation (LINUX)

## Description

This lab guides you through the process of installing and configuring the AppDynamics platform components for an on-premise deployment.  The architecture diagram below shows these components with their communication paths and payloads.  In this lab, you will learn to:
1.Install the Enterprise Console (aka Platform Admin) tool
2.Install and configure the AppDynamics Controller software
3.Install and configure the Events Service
4.Install and configure the End User Monitoring (EUM) Server

The software versions used in the lab are the most recent generally available at the time the lab was created.  As subsequent versions continue to be released, expect slight variations to command line output and screen shot graphics.  Though normally inconsequential, it is recommended to note these differences for reference in troubleshooting should they become significant.

## Setup

# Exercise 1: Enterprise Console (aka Platform Admin)

In this exercise, you will be setting up the Enterprise Console.  This utility provides a browser-based user interface that allows an AppDynamics administrator to install and manage the Controller and Events Service components of the AppDynamics platform.  A CLI for the Enterprise Console is available, but is outside the scope of this lab.  Reference documentation can be found on the AppDynamics documents site - Enterprise Console Documentation.

1. Download the Platform Admin software to the lab host.  The command below assumes you have created an account on www.appdynamics.com and can log into that site with permissions to download software:


1.	Make the installer script executable:s

chmod a+x platform-setup-x64-linux-4.5.x.x.sh

2.	Install the Platform Admin software:

./platform-setup-x64-linux-4.5.x.x.sh

a.	Use /opt/appd/platform as the install destination
b.	Use AppD123 as the database root password
c.	Accept the default database port, 3377
d.	Use AppD123 as the Enterprise Console Database Password
e.	Do not enable HTTPS connections
f.	Enter the public DNS name of the lab EC2 instance
g.	Accept the default Enterprise console port, 9191
h.	Accept the default Enterprise Console Root User name, admin
i.	Set the Enterprise Console Root User Password to AppD123
j.	Confirm AppD123 as the Platform Admin Root User Password

After a few minutes, you should see output similar to that shown below...

Setup has finished installing AppDynamics Enterprise Console on your computer.  To install and manage your AppDynamics Platform, use the Enterprise Console CLI from /opt/appd/platform/platform-admin/bin directory.
Finishing installation â€¦

1.4 -	To confirm the Enterprise Console is functioning properly, verify you can connect to its URL in a web browser and authenticate using the information specified in steps 1.3.g - 1.3.i
